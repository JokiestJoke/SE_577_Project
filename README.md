Project Repository for SE_577


Hello! My name is Mark Doghramji, and I am a Masters Student in Software Engineering. I got into this course, because I am interested in
learning high level designs and architecture. I have seen a lot of theoretical and small samples, but it will be nice to put some of my
recent studies to practical use!
